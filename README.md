## 1. Short Description
This project is a refactored and modernized version of the original vanilla JavaScript currency converter. It is now built using React components and allows users to quickly convert PLN (Polish złoty) to the three major currencies: USD (United States dollar), EUR (Euro), and GBP (British pound sterling).

The application is structured into components for clear separation of concerns, utilizing React's state management for dynamic calculations and UI updates.

## 2. Features

- Component-Based Architecture (React) for modular, reusable code.
- Convert PLN to USD, EUR, and GBP based on hardcoded current exchange rates (easy to upgrade to API fetching).
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Responsive Design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
- Deployment via GitHub Pages using gh-pages.
- links in the footer: 
    - to the project's GitHub repository
    - to contact the creator via email

## 3. Technologies Used

The converter is built with the use of: 
- React 19 (Component library for the UI).
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS (Used within React components)
- BEM convention
- npm / Yarn (For package management).

The following external libraries are used in this project:

- normalize.css - for consistent styling across browsers
- Google Fonts - for the "Roboto" font used throughout the page
- gh-pages - for simplified deployment to GitHub Pages.
